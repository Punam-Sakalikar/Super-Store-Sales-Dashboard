I developed an interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze key performance metrics from a superstore dataset. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, tracking KPIs such as total sales (₹0.25M), profit (₹27K), and quantity sold (4K units). It features time-series analysis to monitor monthly trends across two years (2019–2020), along with detailed breakdowns of sales by customer segments, product categories, sub-categories, and shipping modes. A geographic visualization highlights sales and profit distribution across different U.S. states, while additional insights are drawn from payment mode preferences. This project demonstrates my ability to convert raw business data into meaningful insights through effective data modeling, DAX calculations, and professional dashboard design in Power BI.
